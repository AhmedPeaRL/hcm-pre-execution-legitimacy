# HCM – Pre-Execution Legitimacy

This repository defines the legitimacy of action
*before* execution, not at the moment of execution.

Within the HCM field:
- Permission does not imply desire.
- Capability does not imply obligation.
- Readiness does not imply intent.

An action may exist as a legitimate potential
without ever transitioning into execution.

The system does not wait for execution.
The system does not reward execution.
The system does not interpret non-execution as absence.

Legitimacy here is structural, not temporal.
