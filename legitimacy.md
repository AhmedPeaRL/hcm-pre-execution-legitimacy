Pre-execution legitimacy is the condition where an action
is allowed to exist as a possible state
without requiring manifestation.

This legitimacy is not granted by outcomes,
signals, observers, or time.

An action is legitimate because the field permits it,
not because it occurred.

Non-occurrence does not negate legitimacy.
Occurrence does not enhance it.
